## Community Guidelines

This document outlines community guidelines to ensure a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative environment for everyone contributing to the OneDark ecosystem.

These guidelines apply to all collaborative spaces within the OneDark project, including but not limited to issue trackers, pull requests, mailing lists, chat channels, and code repositories.

1. **Respect Different Perspectives**<br/>
   We encourage open discussions and welcome diverse opinions. Participants should be tolerant of opposing views and engage thoughtfully.
2. **Communicate Respectfully**<br/>
   All participants must ensure their language and actions are free from personal attacks, harassment, or disparaging remarks toward others.
3. **Assume Good Intentions**<br/>
   When interpreting others‚Äô words or actions, please give the benefit of the doubt and assume positive intent.
4. **Zero Tolerance for Harassment**<br/>
   Any behavior that can reasonably be considered harassment or bullying will not be tolerated.
